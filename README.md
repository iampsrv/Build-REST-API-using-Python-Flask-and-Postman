# Build-REST-API-using-Python-Flask-and-Postman

Software is everywhere. We interact with it in our daily life activities knowingly or unknowingly. Each time when you use an app like Instagram, send an instant message, or check the stock prices on your phone, you're using an API. The world still needs more software to make our life easier. But creating great software is hard for everyone and yet developers need to master more than one skill. 

This problem can be solved by API (Application Program Interface). It is a software-to-software interface that enables two applications to exchange data among each other. Just like any buttons on the remote does have a unique function. It is true almost all applications using API to interact with each other.

Enrol in the course by going to this link- [Build-REST-API-using-Python-Flask-and-Postman](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-rest-api-using-python-flask-and-postman/)
Then you can come back here to download the repository. This repository contains the code that we develop in each section of the course.
If you are familiar with Git, you can use Git to download it. Otherwise, you can download it as a zip file:

Next, start taking the course at the beginning! You can use the downloaded code files to support you while you go through the course.

I also strongly recommend you code while you take the course. A good strategy is:

1. Watch the video intently, optionally while taking notes.
2. Watch again, more quickly, while typing the code together with me.
3. Once you're done with the video, play about with the code. Make changes, break things, then fix them, and try to thoroughly understand everything the code does.

If you do this for the entire course, I guarantee you will learn how to make REST APIs using Flask and Python well and quickly.
